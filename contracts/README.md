# Contract Development

## Prettier

Both Solidity and JavaScript code is formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

The configuration for Prettier is in [.prettierrc](./.prettierrc).
This should already be configured in the VS Code settings file [.vscode/settings.json](../.vscode/settings.json). [.prettierignore](./.prettierignore) is used to ignore files from being formatted.

The following package scripts can be used to format code:

```
# Check for any formatting issues
yarn prettier:check

# Format all Solidity files
yarn prettier:sol

# Format all JavaScript files
yarn prettier:js

# Format both Solidity and JavaScript files
yarn prettier
```

## Linter

[solhit](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) is used to lint Solidity code. The configuration for solhint is in [.solhint.json](./.solhint.json). [.solhintignore](./.solhintignore) is used to ignore Solidity files from being linted.

[eslint](https://eslint.org/) is used to lint JavaScript code. The configuration for eslint is in [.eslintrc.js](./.eslintrc.js).

```
# Check for any Solidity linting issues
yarn lint:sol

# Check for any JavaScript linting issues
yarn lint:sol

# Check for any Solidity or JavaScript linting issues
yarn lint
```

## Slither

[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither#slither-the-solidity-source-analyzer) is used to for Solidity static analysis.

The [Slither installation](https://github.com/crytic/slither#how-to-install) instruction.

```
## Run Slither
yarn slither
```

## Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is used to compile, test, and deploy contracts. The configuration for Hardhat is in [hardhat.config.js](./hardhat.config.js).

```
# Compile changed contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Recompile all contracts
yarn clean
npx hardhat compile
```

Alternatively, the Hardhat companion npm package [hardhat-shorthand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-shorthand) can be used as a shorthand for npx hardhat. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/command-line-completion#installation).

```
## Compile
hh compile

## Tasks
hh task
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Hardhat tests are used for contract unit tests which are under the [test](./test) folder. Contract mocks are under the [contracts/mocks](./contracts/mocks) folder.

```
# Run all unit tests
yarn test
```

### Fork Tests

Set your `PROVIDER_URL` and desired `BLOCK_NUMBER` in your [.env](./.env) file. The can be copied from [dev.env](./dev.env).

```
# in one terminal
yarn run node

# in another terminal
yarn test:fork
```

See [Fork Tests](./fork-test.md) for more information.

### Echidna tests

[Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna#echidna-a-fast-smart-contract-fuzzer-) is used for fuzzing tests.

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/crytic/echidna#installation).

```
# Run Echidna tests
yarn echidna
```

## Logger

A logger using the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) packages is used for logging tests and tasks.

To use, import the [utils/logger.js](./utils/logger.js) file and specify the module you are logging from. For example

```js
const log = require("../utils/logger")("module-name");
log("something interesting happened");
```

The module name is appended to `origin:`, so the above example would log `origin:module-name something interesting happened`.

To enable, export the `DEBUG` environment variable.

```
# enable all logging
export DEBUG=origin*

# enable logging for a specific module
export DEBUG=origin:module-name*
```

Example module names

- utils:1inch
- utils:curve
- test:unit:vault
- test:fork:vault
- test:fork:oeth:metapool

## Contract Sizes

The Hardhat plug-in [hardhat-contract-sizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-contract-sizer) is used to report the size of contracts.

This is not enabled by default. To enable, export the `CONTRACT_SIZE` environment variable.

```
export CONTRACT_SIZE=true
```

The contract sizes will be output after the contracts are compiled. Here's a sample of the first few.

```
Compiled 155 Solidity files successfully

```

## Gas Usage

The Hardhat plug-in [hardhat-gas-reporter](https://github.com/cgewecke/hardhat-gas-reporter#hardhat-gas-reporter) is used to report gas usage of unit and fork tests.

This is not enabled by default. To enable, export the `REPORT_GAS` environment variable.

```
export REPORT_GAS=true
```

If enabled, the gas usage will be output in a table after the tests have executed. For example

```

```

## Contract Verification

The Hardhat plug-in [@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan) is used to verify contracts on Etherscan.

There's an example

```
npx hardhat --network mainnet verify --contract contracts/vault/VaultAdmin.sol:VaultAdmin 0x31a91336414d3B955E494E7d485a6B06b55FC8fB
```

## Continuous Integration

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used for the build. The configuration for GitHub Actions is in [.github/workflows/defi.yml](../.github/workflows/defi.yml). The action workflows can be found at https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/actions.

There are separate actions for:

- Contract formatting and linting
- Dapp formatting and linting
- Slither static analysis
- Unit tests
- Fork tests

## Coverage

The Hardhat plug-in [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage#solidity-coverage) is used to gather Solidity code coverage. The configuration is in [.solcover.js](./.solcover.js). The coverage output is written to `coverage.json`.

[Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) is used to report Solidity code coverage. The coverage reports for this repository can be found [here](https://app.codecov.io/gh/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar).

```
# Unit test coverage
yarn test:coverage

# For test coverage
yarn test:fork:coverage
```

The CI will upload the coverage reports to Codecov if they complete successfully.
