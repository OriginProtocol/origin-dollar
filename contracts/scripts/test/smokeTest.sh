# Runs smoke tests to verify that contract changes don't break the basic functionality.
# They can be run 2 ways: 
#
# 1. With `deployid` parameter. Example: `scripts/test/smokeTest.sh --deployid 11`
# When this mode is used
# - all the before functions of smoke tests are ran.
# - contract upgrade specified by the `deployid` is executed
# - all the after functions of the smoke tests are ran. Verifying that the upgrade hasn't broken
#   the expected behavior
#
#
# 2. With no `deployid` parameter AKA the interactive mode.
# When this mode is used:
# - all the before functions of smoke tests are ran
# - process is waiting for user input, so user can connect to the node using hardhat console and
#   execute commands on contracts. 
# - user confirms with `Enter` that the after functions of the smoke tests can continue.
# - process waits for confirmation again to repeat the process


# any child processes created by this process are killed once the main process is terminated
