/// @title Native Staking SSV Strategy
/// @notice Strategy to deploy funds into DVT validators powered by the SSV Network
/// @author Origin Protocol Inc
/// @dev This contract handles WETH and ETH and in some operations interchanges between the two. Any WETH that
/// is on the contract across multiple blocks (and not just transitory within a transaction) is considered an
/// asset. Meaning deposits increase the balance of the asset and withdrawal decrease it. As opposed to all
/// our other strategies the WETH doesn't immediately get deposited into an underlying strategy and can be present
/// across multiple blocks waiting to be unwrapped to ETH and staked to validators. This separation of WETH and ETH is
/// required since the rewards (reward token) is also in ETH.
///
/// To simplify the accounting of WETH there is another difference in behavior compared to the other strategies.
/// To withdraw WETH asset - exit message is posted to validators and the ETH hits this contract with multiple days
/// delay. In order to simplify the WETH accounting upon detection of such an event the ValidatorAccountant
/// immediately wraps ETH to WETH and sends it to the Vault.
///
/// On the other hand any ETH on the contract (across multiple blocks) is there either:
///  - as a result of already accounted for consensus rewards
///  - as a result of not yet accounted for consensus rewards
///  - as a results of not yet accounted for full validator withdrawals (or validator slashes)
///
/// Even though the strategy assets and rewards are a very similar asset the consensus layer rewards and the
/// execution layer rewards are considered rewards and those are dripped to the Vault over a configurable time
/// interval and not immediately.
